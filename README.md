## Starting the app

- Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed.

- You will also need the [React Native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to start the app. Please consult the documents for installing the CLI on your computer.

- Open a Terminal window and go to the repo root. From the root, run `$ npm install` or `$ yarn install`. Wait until all the dependencies have finished loading.

- In another Terminal window, run `$ react-native run-ios` to fire up the iOS simulator. Two separate tabs will open in your Terminal. One tab displays the status of the Xcode build that creates the actual iOS application. You'll have to wait patiently while Xcode builds the app. The other tab opens the React Packager that loads the dependencies. When the iOS simulator pops open, the app splash page should load.
